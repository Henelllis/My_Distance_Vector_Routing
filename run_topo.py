# This how you run the topology and have it execute the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
# Generically, it is run as follows:
#     python run_topo.py <topology_file> <log_file>
# For instance, to run topo1.py and log to topo1.log that we created, use the following:
#     python run_topo.py topo1 topo1.log
# Note how the topology file doesn't have the .py extension.
#
# Students should not modify this file.
